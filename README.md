<!-- the Weather Clothing app Part 2  -->

# Backstory:
You're expanding the app you helped your friend with. Now, instead of just suggesting an outfit for one day, you want to suggest outfits for an entire week. The user should be able to input the weather forecast for each day, and the app will provide outfit recommendations for the entire week.

# Objective:
Write a Python program that loops through each day of the week and asks the user for the weather forecast for each day and then recommends an outfit for each day accordingly.

# Task 
- Loop through seven days (using a for loop).
- For each day, prompt the user to describe the day's weather: "What's the forecast for Day X? (rainy, sunny, or cold)"
- Use conditional statements to determine the outfit recommendation for that day.
- Store or directly print the recommendation.

# Example Recommendations (as before)- input:output :

Rainy: "Day X: Wear a raincoat and carry an umbrella."
Sunny: "Day X: Wear a t-shirt and sunglasses!"
Cold: "Day X: Put on a heavy jacket and a scarf."

# Requirements
- Use a 'for' loop to cycle through each of the seven days.
- Use a 'conditional statement' to provide outfit recommendations
